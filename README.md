# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning  

> Predicted used car prices with Machine Learning models, balancing accuracy, prediction speed, and training time for Rusty Bargain app.  

✅ Español: Predicción de precios de autos usados con modelos de Machine Learning, equilibrando precisión, velocidad de predicción y tiempo de entrenamiento para la app de Rusty Bargain.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Sprint 14: Numerical Methods** module at TripleTen Latam.  
The task was to support **Rusty Bargain**, a used-car sales service developing an app to quickly estimate market values of cars.  

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed  
- Prepared and analyzed a dataset of used cars (history, technical specifications, equipment versions, prices).  
- Developed and trained multiple Machine Learning models to predict market value.  
- Compared models based on:  
  - **Prediction accuracy**  
  - **Prediction speed**  
  - **Training time**  
- Selected the most balanced model to optimize app performance.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (regression models, performance comparison)  
- Time measurement tools for training and prediction benchmarking  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Built models capable of predicting car prices with competitive accuracy.  
- Benchmarked models based on speed vs accuracy trade-off.  
- Selected a final model optimized for deployment in Rusty Bargain’s customer app.
